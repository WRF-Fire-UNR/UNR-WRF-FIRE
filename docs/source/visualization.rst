**How to Install Ncview on Linux**

Linux users can install Ncview from Advanced Package Tool (apt-get) using the following command:

::

   $ sudo apt-get install ncview

   Mac users can install Ncview using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>: <br><br>
  
::

   $ brew install ncview

**How to Use Ncview**

netCDF files can be opened in Ncview using the following command on both Linux and Mac:

::

   $ ncview (path to the netcdf file)/(netcdf file)

After the file is opened in Ncview, variables in the netCDF file can be viewed from variables menu (see below figure).

After selecting the variable of interest, it will be shown in XY plane using color-filled contours.

Ncview can also plot 2D graphs of the selected variable. By left-clicking on a point of interest from the output window, Ncview generates a graph showing the value of the chosen variable with respect to a transect passing the chosen point.
