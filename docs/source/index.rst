Introduction to WRF-Fire
========================
 
How to use this wiki and where to begin?
----------------------------------------
This Wiki aims to tutor WRF-Fire using a variety of examples with incrementally increasing level of complexity, ranging from basic uncoupled models to nested coupled models in the LES mode. In addition, tutorials are provided on :ref:`Compiling WRF-Fire for Mac <compileMac>`, :ref:`Compiling WRF-Fire for Linux <compileLin>`, :ref:`Running WRF-Fire <runWRF>`, :ref:`Key WRF-Fire and WRF commands <keyCommands>`, and :ref:`Visualization tools <visualization>`.

**If you have preliminary experience with WRF and/or WRF-Fire,** start with the examples along with the commands tutorials to learn WRF-Fire. You can also review the visualization tutorials, which include Python codes developed exclusively for visualizing WRF-Fire outputs.

**If you are a new user to WRF world,** we suggest to pursue the following steps to get acquainted with WRF-Fire. 

 - :ref:`- Step 1:<DCR>` Compiling WRF-Fire for idealized cases
 - :ref:`- Step 2:<idealized>` Running one of the test cases, namely “hill_simple” and “two_fires”, distributed with WRF-Fire.
 - :ref:`- Step 3:<Ncview>` Visualizing the outputs of test cases using Ncview.
 - :ref:`- Step 4:<tutorials>` After getting acquainted with WRF-Fire, you can follow the examples and commands tutorials to learn how to create different WRF-Fire models. You can also follow visualization tutorials for more visualization tools and options.

Enjoy learning WRF-Fire!
